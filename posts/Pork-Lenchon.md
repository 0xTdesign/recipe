### Pork Lenchon

### Ingredients:

1 slab (5 lbs) pork belly, bones removed
3 stalks lemongrass leaves
3 pieces scallions
1 small red onion, sliced
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons fresh milk
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon canola oil

### Instructions:

Lay the pork belly on a flat surface with the skin facing down. Rub the salt and pepper all over the meat part. Let it stand for 15 minutes.
Arrange the lemongrass, scallions, and onion slices on one side of the belly. Roll the pork belly tightly from that side to the opposite side, forming a spiral shape. Secure the rolled pork belly with kitchen twine. Rub the oil all over the skin.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the pork belly in a roasting pan and roast for 2 hours.
Remove the belly from the oven and brush it with fresh milk. Return it to the oven and continue roasting for 30 minutes or until the skin is brown and crispy.
Remove from the oven and let it cool down for 15 minutes. Slice the roasted pork belly and serve with homemade lechon sauce.
Enjoy the delicious and crispy roasted pork belly!
