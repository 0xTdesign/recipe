# INGREDIENTS

- 12 oz (350 g) pitted ready-to-eat prunes
- 10 oz (275 g) ready-to-eat dried apricots
- 10 oz (275 g) pitted dates
- 1 lb (450 g) onions, peeled

- 1 level dessertspoon grated fresh root ginger or 1 heaped teaspoon ground ginger
- 3 oz (75 g) allspice berries
- 1 lb (450 g) demerara sugar

# Instructions

Chop the dried fruits and onions very small using a food processor, mincer, or a sharp knife.
In a large saucepan, combine the vinegar, salt, and ginger. Securely tie the allspice berries in a piece of muslin or gauze and add them to the pan.
Bring the mixture to a boil, then stir in the chopped dried fruits, onions, and sugar.
Simmer gently without a lid for about 1Â½ hours or until the chutney thickens, stirring occasionally.
To prepare the jar, wash it thoroughly in warm soapy water, rinse, dry, and heat it in a moderate oven for 5 minutes.
Spoon the cooked chutney into the warmed jar, seal tightly with waxed discs and lids, and label when cold.
Allow the chutney to mature for 1 month before eating.
Enjoy the flavorful chutney!
