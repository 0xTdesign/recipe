# INGREDIENTS

- 1 lb cod (See Note 1)
- 8 corn tortillas
- Oil for frying

Batter:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup Mexican beer
  Slaw:

- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup Mexican crema
- 2 limes, juiced
- 2 tbsp cilantro, chopped
- 1 tbsp honey
- 2 cups green cabbage, shredded

Garnish:

- 2 limes, quartered
- Cilantro
- Pico de Gallo
- Salsa Verde

# Instructions

1. Season the fish on both sides with salt and set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the slaw dressing ingredients. Add the shredded cabbage and toss to coat. Set aside.
3. In a shallow bowl, mix together the batter ingredients, whisking to avoid any lumps.
4. Heat oil to 350Â°F in a large skillet (cast iron preferred), deep pot, or fryer.
5. Dip each piece of fish into the batter, allowing excess batter to drip off. Carefully drop it into the hot oil.
6. Fry the fish, turning to brown both sides, for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate. Season with salt. Repeat with all the fish.
7. Warm the tortillas over an open flame or in a dry skillet.
8. Assemble the tacos by adding fried fish and cabbage slaw to each tortilla. Serve with lime wedges, cilantro, and your choice of pico de gallo or salsa verde.
